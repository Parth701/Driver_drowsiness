# 💤 Driver Drowsiness Detection

A real-time system that detects driver drowsiness using face and eye monitoring. The project uses Python, OpenCV, and Dlib to process live webcam feed and trigger alerts when drowsiness is detected.

## 📌 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍  
- OpenCV (cv2) 🎥  
- Dlib 💠  
- NumPy 🔢  
- Scikit-learn (optional for model improvements) 🤖

## 📂 Project Description

This system is designed to prevent road accidents caused by drowsy driving. It monitors the driver's eye movements and raises an alarm if signs of drowsiness (like long eye closure) are detected.

### ✅ Key Features:

- Real-time face and eye detection using Dlib and OpenCV  
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) calculation to monitor eye closure  
- Triggers audio alarm if EAR drops below a threshold  
- Uses webcam to capture live video feed
